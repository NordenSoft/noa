/**
 * THE KNOCKOUT RUNNER — evidence-based verdicts, hash-verified restoration, known baselines.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS REPLACED THE OLD LOOP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The previous runner decided `verdict: r.green ? "SURVIVED" : "KILLED"`. Any non-zero exit was
 * KILLED — a real detection, a pre-existing failure, a compile error, a crash and a timeout were all
 * the same value. It also took no baseline, so a suite that was ALREADY red reported KILLED for
 * every mutation.
 *
 * MEASURED (R8-26/R8-27, 2026-07-31). Six of thirty-four entries target `packages/gate`, whose
 * baseline is `exit 1, 200 pass / 2 fail` — two owner-deferred ADR-0006 failures. Setting one
 * entry's `replace` to be BYTE-IDENTICAL to its `find`, so the source file does not change at all:
 *
 *     node scripts/lint-control-knockout.mjs --only grant-single-use-cas
 *     ok  grant-single-use-cas   …   killed 1/1
 *
 * A no-op scored a kill. Those six entries were measuring the two deferred failures, not their own
 * controls.
 *
 * And the mutation was written straight into the canonical worktree (`fs.writeFileSync(ROOT/…)`),
 * restored only in a `finally`, with nothing verifying that the restore actually matched. A crash
 * between write and restore left a weakened control on disk, and a concurrent build would have
 * compiled it. Round 8 observed `git status` rotating through modified `src/cose/cbor.ts`,
 * `src/intrinsics.ts` and `src/verify.ts` during a run.
 *
 * ── WHAT A KNOCKOUT NOW HAS TO PROVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A knockout result is evidence only if the framework can show all six:
 *   1. the target file matched its expected baseline BEFORE the mutation (sha256);
 *   2. the mutation actually changed the bytes (post-mutation sha256 differs);
 *   3. the suite's CLEAN baseline is known, so "it failed" can be distinguished from "it was
 *      already failing";
 *   4. the failure set under mutation STRICTLY CONTAINS the baseline failure set — i.e. this
 *      knockout broke something the baseline did not;
 *   5. the file was restored to the exact baseline sha256;
 *   6. the worktree carries no residue.
 *
 * Anything else gets a verdict that says what actually happened, from a CLOSED taxonomy. There is
 * no "probably".
